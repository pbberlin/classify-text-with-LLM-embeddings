### Upcoming projects hope to use LLMs

1.  Kathi's projects on CbCR need an easy way to extract taxation parameters from weakly structured texts 
2.  Zareh's textual data collection on municipal taxation  
Needs to be mined for
    * Business tax rates
    * Period in time
    * Own municipality vs. other municipalities

<!--h-->

### But also for `concepts`

  * Perceived `competitive networks`
  * Tax multipliers 
  * Various narratives
  * ...


<!--h-->

3.  Project "Geld und WÃ¤hrung"  
    * Classification of official speeches  
4.  Financial markets dept
    * research into pension policy -  
      classify pension policy discussion against basic concepts
    * financial literacy -  
      limits of capturing `financial calculus` with LLMs


=> Time to establish some foundations.
