        "short": "balcony flowers and herbs",
        "long": "Gardening on the balcony can transform a small outdoor space into a lush oasis. With the right selection of plants, even a modest balcony can bloom vibrantly. Suitable flowers for balcony gardening include petunias, marigolds, and geraniums. These flowers thrive in containers and offer a burst of color throughout the growing season. For a fragrant touch, consider adding lavender or jasmine.\r\n\r\nHerbs and spices are perfect companions to these floral beauties. Basil, mint, and parsley are well-suited for balcony gardens and can enhance your culinary creations. Rosemary and thyme are also excellent choices, providing robust flavors and aromatic foliage. These herbs are relatively low-maintenance and thrive in sunny spots.\r\n\r\nWatering is crucial for container plants. Due to limited soil volume, containers dry out faster than garden beds. Water your balcony plants regularly, ensuring the soil stays moist but not waterlogged. Early morning or late evening is the best time to water, reducing evaporation and preventing fungal diseases.\r\n\r\nFertilization is vital for the health and growth of balcony plants. Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every two weeks during the growing season. Organic options, like compost tea or fish emulsion, can provide essential nutrients while being environmentally friendly. Regular feeding ensures your plants remain vigorous and productive, turning your balcony into a green haven.\r\n"
